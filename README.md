# KIVA: Handheld AI Assistant

## Introduction

**KIVA** is a compact, handheld AI assistant designed to blend ancient wisdom with modern technology. The name "KIVA" is derived from:

-   **"Ki"**: Inspired by Lord Krishna (symbolizing wisdom and guidance) and the Japanese concept of "Ki" (energy, spirit).
-   **"Va"**: From "Varta" (Sanskrit for existence, movement, life's flow).

KIVA aims to be a digital "charioteer"—a guide and companion, providing assistance and insights much like Krishna guided Arjuna in the Bhagavad Gita.

## Motivation

The primary goal of KIVA is to create a personalized, portable AI assistant that:

-   Offers a sleek, minimalist design.
-   Provides both voice and visual interaction.
-   Prioritizes privacy and local processing.
-   Is fully customizable and open-source.

## Hardware Details

KIVA is built around the **Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32S3 Sense**, chosen for its small form factor, integrated features, and processing power.

### Core Components:

-   **Microcontroller:** Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32S3 Sense
    -   Integrated camera and digital microphone.
    -   Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities.
-   **Display:** 128x128 pixel, surface-flush, integrated into a custom 3D-printed enclosure.
-   **Audio Input:**
    -   I2S Microphone Module (for high-quality audio capture).
-   **Audio Output:**
    -   Small 8Ω 1W speaker.
    -   PAM8403 amplifier module.
-   **Storage:**
    -   MicroSD card reader module.
    -    32 GB MicroSD Card.
-   **Power:**
    -   Rechargeable Li-Po battery (3.7V).
    -   TP4056-based charging module.
-   **Input:**
    -   Custom scroll wheel (rotary encoder or capacitive).
    -   Up to 3 physical buttons.
-  **I/O Expander:**
    - PCF8574T I2C 8 Bit IO GPIO expander module
- **I2C Multiplexer:**
    - CJMCU TCA9548A 12C 8 Channel Multiple Extensions Development Board

### Component Justification:

-   **XIAO ESP32S3 Sense:** Provides a balance of size, power, and integrated features (camera, mic, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth).
-   **I2S Microphone:** Offers better audio quality than analog mics.
-   **Small Speaker + Amplifier:** Delivers clear audio output in a compact form.
-   **Custom Scroll Wheel & Buttons:** Enable intuitive navigation and control.
-   **Touchscreen Display:** Provides a visual interface for interaction and feedback.

## Kiva OS: Software & Conceptual Design

### Abstract Overview:

Kiva OS is envisioned as a lightweight, modular software layer designed to:

-   Manage hardware resources efficiently.
-   Provide a responsive and intuitive user interface.
-   Handle voice input and audio output.
-   Enable AI processing (offloaded to a more powerful device or server).
-   Support customization and extensibility.

### Practical Implications:

1.  **Minimalist UI:**
    -   Pure black background with white/grayscale elements.
    -   Animated "Ki" logo (Anurati font) that transitions between states (idle/active).
    -   Clean, modern layout with minimal distractions.

2.  **Voice Interaction:**
    -   Wake-word detection (potentially using TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers or offloading to a server).
    -   Speech-to-text (STT) and text-to-speech (TTS) processing (likely offloaded).

3.  **Modular Design:**
    -   Allows for easy addition of new features and capabilities.
    -   Facilitates community contributions and customization.

4.  **Real-time Responsiveness:**
    -   Optimized for low latency to ensure a smooth user experience.

5. **Connectivity**
    - Connects to a home lab server to use AI features.

### UI Design Concepts:

-   **Animated "Ki" Logo:** Serves as a central visual element, indicating the device's state (idle/active).
-   **Dark Mode:** Pure black background for a sleek, high-contrast look.
-   **Typography:** Anurati for the logo; a clean sans-serif font (e.g., Inter, Roboto) for other UI elements.
-   **Layout:** Minimalist, with a focus on essential information and controls.

### Design Concepts for 3D-Printed Enclosure:
- **Inspiration:** Kingston USB drive (angular, geometric, layered design).
- **Material:** Matte black PLA or resin.
- **Features:**
    -   Snap-fit or sliding mechanism for easy assembly.
    -   Integrated ventilation.
    -   Ergonomic placement of components.
    -   Surface-flush display integration.
