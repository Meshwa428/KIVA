# KIVA Project: Feature & Settings Roadmap

This document outlines the implemented, planned, and proposed features for the KIVA device, focusing on user settings, quality of life improvements, and advanced hardware control.

## Phase 1: Core Settings Framework (Implemented)

This foundational phase is complete, providing a robust system for user customization.

- **âœ… Centralized Settings Management (`ConfigManager`)**

  - **Description:** A unified system for managing all device settings.
  - **Persistence:** Uses a hybrid model, loading from fast EEPROM on boot, with a human-readable JSON file (`/config/settings.json`) on the SD card as a backup. Automatically creates default settings if none exist.
  - **Benefit:** Ensures user preferences are saved instantly and persist across reboots for a reliable and consistent experience.

- **âœ… Redesigned Settings Menu**

  - **Description:** A scalable, list-based menu for all configuration options.
  - **Benefit:** Provides a clean, intuitive, and extensible interface for all current and future settings.

- **âœ… Unified & Individual Brightness Control**

  - **Description:**
    1.  A main "Brightness" slider in the settings menu controls both displays simultaneously for quick adjustments.
    2.  An advanced "Twin Dial" UI, accessible via the `A` button, allows for independent control of the Main and Auxiliary display brightness.
  - **Benefit:** Offers both simplicity for common use and granular control for power users, allowing them to optimize for stealth or battery life.

- **âœ… Persistent Keyboard Layout Selection**

  - **Description:** A global setting to choose the keyboard layout (e.g., US, UK, DE) for all HID-related functions.
  - **Benefit:** Critical for international users and ensures Ducky Scripts execute correctly on various target systems without needing to modify script files.

- **âœ… Configurable OTA Password**
  - **Description:** The password for both Web and IDE OTA updates is now a persistent setting, editable via the on-screen keyboard.
  - **Benefit:** Enhances security by allowing the user to change the default password and simplifies management by removing the need to edit SD card files.

## Phase 2: High-Impact Features (Next to Implement)

These features will add significant new capabilities, transforming the device from a simple tool into a versatile platform.

- **ðŸ”„ Screen Timeout (Sleep Mode)**

  - **Plan:** Implement an inactivity timer that puts both OLED displays into a low-power sleep state. Any button press will wake them instantly.
  - **Benefit:** The single most effective feature for **dramatically increasing battery life**. Also enhances stealth by automatically blanking the screens.

- **ðŸ”„ Headless Mode ("Arm for Boot")**

  - **Plan:** Create a setting to pre-configure an action (e.g., Run Ducky Script, Start Beacon Spam) to execute immediately on boot, bypassing the UI entirely.
  - **Benefit:** Transforms the KIVA into a **deployable hardware payload**. A user can "arm" the device, plug it into a target, and have it execute its mission autonomously upon receiving power.

- **ðŸ”„ Profiles Manager**

  - **Plan:** A system to save and load the entire settings configuration as named profiles (e.g., "Stealth", "Presentation", "Attack").
  - **Benefit:** A massive efficiency boost for power users, allowing them to switch between entire device configurations for different operational scenarios in seconds.

- **ðŸ”„ Customizable BLE Keymapper**
  - **Plan:** A dedicated mode where the physical navigation buttons are mapped to custom keyboard presses or shortcuts, sent over BLE. A new settings screen will allow users to configure these mappings.
  - **Benefit:** Turns the device into a powerful, customizable **BLE remote control** for presentations, media playback, or triggering complex macros on a host computer.

## Phase 3: Quality of Life & Advanced Customization

These features will refine the user experience, add personalization, and provide deeper control for advanced users.

- **âœ¨ Persistent Vibration Setting**

  - **Plan:** A global toggle in settings to enable or disable all haptic feedback.
  - **Benefit:** Provides full control over the device's physical feedback, essential for situations requiring complete silence.

- **âœ¨ Configurable BLE Device Name**

  - **Plan:** An option to change the advertised Bluetooth name of the device using the on-screen keyboard.
  - **Benefit:** Enhances **social engineering and stealth** by allowing the device to masquerade as an innocuous peripheral like "Logitech Mouse" or "JBL Speaker".

- **âœ¨ Status Bar Customization**

  - **Plan:** A new settings submenu with toggles to show/hide elements like the battery percentage, voltage, etc.
  - **Benefit:** Allows users to **personalize their workspace** by de-cluttering the UI to show only the information they deem critical.

- **âœ¨ Encoder Direction Flip**

  - **Plan:** A simple toggle to reverse the scrolling direction of the rotary encoder.
  - **Benefit:** An important **ergonomic and accessibility feature** that makes the device feel more intuitive for all users, regardless of their preference.

- **âœ¨ Boot Animation Toggle**

  - **Plan:** An option to disable the boot progress bar animation.
  - **Benefit:** Provides a **faster boot time** for experienced users who prefer to get to the main menu as quickly as possible.

- **âœ¨ Factory Reset with Backup**

  - **Plan:** A "Factory Reset" option that, after confirmation, moves all configuration files to a timestamped backup folder, wipes the EEPROM, and reboots the device.
  - **Benefit:** A critical **safety and recovery mechanism**. The backup feature is a crucial safeguard against accidental data loss.

- **âœ¨ Log & Capture Rotation (Auto-Cleanup)**
  - **Plan:** A setting to automatically keep only the X most recent log and capture files, deleting the oldest ones to free up space.
  - **Benefit:** "Set and forget" storage management that **prevents the SD card from filling up**, ensuring the device is always ready to capture new data.


#### **1. The "Arm for Boot" System**

This is the ultimate evolution of your workflow idea. It eliminates menus *entirely* for pre-planned operations.

*   **How it Works:** We will add a new top-level option in the `Settings` menu called **"Arm for Boot"**.
    *   Selecting this opens a `ListMenu` that presents a list of *every possible action* the device can perform (e.g., "Run Ducky Script...", "Start Beacon Spam (Random)", "Start Evil Twin...", "Start Handshake Sniffer (PMKID)").
    *   When the user selects an action, they may be prompted for a final parameter if necessary (e.g., choosing the specific Ducky Script from a list).
    *   Once confirmed, the device saves this "armed action" to a special configuration file on the SD card (e.g., `/config/armed_action.json`).
    *   The screen will now display a persistent, clear visual indicator (e.g., a red "ARMED" icon in the status bar) to show it's in this state.

*   **The Boot Logic Change:** At the very beginning of `App::setup()`, before any UI is initialized, the code will:
    1.  Check if `/config/armed_action.json` exists.
    2.  If it exists, it will *completely bypass the entire menu system*.
    3.  It will read the action, initialize only the necessary modules (e.g., `DuckyScriptRunner`), and execute the mission. The screen might only show a minimal "Executing..." status.

*   **User Experience:** A pentester wants to run a BadUSB attack.
    1.  They navigate to `Settings -> Arm for Boot -> Run Ducky Script...`.
    2.  They select `get_creds.txt` from the list.
    3.  The screen now shows "ARMED". They power off the KIVA.
    4.  They walk up to the target machine and plug it in. The moment KIVA gets power, it identifies as a keyboard and runs `get_creds.txt` without ever showing the main menu. **Zero clicks, maximum speed and stealth.**
